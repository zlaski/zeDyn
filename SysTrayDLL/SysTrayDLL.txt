Title: A Complete & Easy SysTray Dll
Description: This dll and test project allow you to easily place an icon in the system tray and set its tooltip. This dll provides MouseMove, MouseDown, MouseUp, Click, DoubleClick, Minimize, and Restore events, and allows you to easily minimize a form to the tray. You can also specify a popup menu, and how it responds. (eg: on right click,double click etc...)
I've added a new property (Persistent) which reloads the icon if Explorer crashes. Please let me know if you find any bugs with it.
